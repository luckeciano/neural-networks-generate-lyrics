Why do said of always tway ford you stones
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of all the stare me
Can feel whatever you feel
Together we build now
Shine it so las the nights out light
Somete now
If I always make me feel brand new
lfye stremand me, not to kallyding
But the ans the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of all the stare me
Can feel whatever you feel
Together we build now
Shine it so las the nights out light
